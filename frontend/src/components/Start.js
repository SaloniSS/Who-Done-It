      <h2>Who Done It? Famous Detective Edition!</h2>
      <p>
        Sherlock Holmes sent invitations to the world's best detectives for his
        dinner party. You received one and are heading over. Once you get there,
        you interact with the other guests for a bit. After waiting for Holmesâ€™
        arrival for a long time, you and the other confused guests began to
        search for the host. You hear a gasp and go upstairs to the origin. When
        you walk in, you see Holmes' dead body on the floor. Doctor Watson calls
        the time of death recently thus the murderer must be inside the mansion.
        It is up to you to find the killer, and you can't trust anyone!
